# Employee Attrition Report:
This project was completed as part of the Women Techsters Bootcamp (WTB), focusing on analyzing employee attrition using Excel. The goal was to identify factors driving attrition and provide actionable insights through data analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview:
**Dataset**: HR Attrition Dataset with 2925 employee records, including columns like Attrition, Age, Job Roles, Gender, Department, and more.
**Tools**: Excel (formulas, pivot tables, charts).
**Analysis**: Explored attrition by gender, age group (18-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50 & above), Job Roles, Education and Field of study, department, marital status, and years since last promotion. During Analysis, new columns were added to the original dataset (employee attrition status, age group) to facilitate data processing, categorization, and deeper insights into the factors driving employee attrition.
**Visualization**: Created a dashboard to present findings.
 
## Key Insights
 **Attrition Rate**: 17% overall.
 **High-Risk Groups**: Younger employees (20-29, 30-39) R&D and Sales department (282 and 186 attrition).
 **Gender**: Males had a higher attrition (63% vs. 37% for females).
**Marital Status**: Single employees showed 50% attrition, compaired to that of married employees (35%).
