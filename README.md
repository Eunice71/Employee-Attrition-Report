Project Description:

The Employee Attrition Report project was completed as part of the Women Techsters Bootcamp (WTB) to analyze factors driving employee turnover using a dataset of 2923 employee records. this project was conducted in Excel, and involved data cleaning, pivot analysis, and visualizations to uncover actionable insights for reducing attrition.

Objective: Identify key reasons of employee attrition by examining factors such as age, age, gender, department, marital status, education, education fields, job roles and year since last promotion.

Dataset: The HR Attrition Dataset includes columns like Attrition (Yes/No), Age, Department, Monthly Income, and more, cleaned to remove duplicates, standardize formats, and handle missing values. Additional new column were formed to help identify drivers of employee attrition

Analysis: Excel formulas (e.g. COUNTIF, COUNTIFS, IFS) to segment by categories (e.g., age groups: 18-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50 & above).

Visualization: Created a dashboard with charts (bar, column, pie) to highlight trends.

Key Insights:
  - Overall attrition rate: 17%.
  - R&D department showed the highest employee attrition (282).
  - more attrition in males (63%).
  - more singles left the organization (50%).

Recommendations: Suggested targeted retention programs for R&D and Sales staff, improved onboarding for younger employees, and workload adjustments to reduce turnover.
